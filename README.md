# Keylogger - Capturing Keystrokes using Python

This project implements a keylogger using Python to capture and record keystrokes made on a computer. The keylogger runs in the background, logging keystrokes from the connected keyboard. The captured data can be used for various purposes such as user interaction analysis, behavior studies, or security monitoring.

## Features

- Captures keystrokes from the keyboard connected to the computer.
- Stores the captured keystrokes securely for further analysis or transmission.
- Enhances user interaction and user experience by leveraging the captured keystrokes.
- Provides options for data analysis, pattern recognition, or sentiment analysis.
- Offers potential applications in security monitoring, research, software development, and educational contexts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/keylogger.git
   
2. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the `gui.py` script:

2. You can able to see three options start, log, and exit

3. Press start button 

4. The keylogger will start capturing keystrokes in the background.

5. Press `Esc` to stop the keylogger and terminate the program.

6. The captured keystrokes will be stored in a log file for further analysis.

## Configuration

- Edit the `python` file to specify the log file path and customize any other settings.

## Security and Privacy

Please note that the use of keyloggers must adhere to legal and ethical guidelines. Ensure that you have proper consent and comply with applicable laws and regulations before using this code. Respect user privacy and take necessary precautions to protect the captured data.
